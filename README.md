# Crypto Gamehub*

Crypto Gamehub is a web collection of minigames to promote the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain based platforms in a very fun way. We also want to educate about the good use of such platforms, like flagging spammers, supporting the begginers, and the good behavior in general.

This hub will be available to the community for web integration onto their own sites. (Check "How to install" section).

The people of the community are encouraged to contribute their own minigames to this hub. (Check "How to contribute" section).

## SPAMPIG
**Objective** To educate about spam in STEEM platforms.

And remember: Never leave spam comments!
