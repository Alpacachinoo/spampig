# Name pending
Name pending is a game to promote the use of cryptocurrencies and social media based in blockchain with minigames in a very fun way.

# The games

## Spampig
**Objective** To educate about spam in STEEM platforms.

The Spampig is trying to catch upvotes, but your mission is to feed him only with flags! If he gets an upvote he says an spammy comment.

And remember: Never leave spam comments!

# Build #2

## Notes:
The current version of Spam Pig utilises temporary assets that do not reflect the overarching theme of this mini-game. The actual assets will hopefully be implemented in Build #3 (A big hint towards our future plans with this project lies somewhere within this sentence :P )

## Changes:
* Dedicated main-menu scene.
* Removed a couple of temporary assets in preparation for actual assets.

## Bug Fixes:
* Collision detection.

## Bugs To Address:
* Saving & Loading high scores.
* Initial lag when interacting with a object.
